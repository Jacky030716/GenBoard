# Create Component

Begin by setting up a new React component called `Calculator`. Use buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (+, -, ร, รท).

## Instructions

1. Create a new file `Calculator.jsx`.
2. Add buttons for numbers and operators.
3. Use React state (`useState`) to track the current input and result.
4. Handle user input and display calculation on the screen.

This component will serve as the foundation of your calculator app.
