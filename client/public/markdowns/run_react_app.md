# ▶️ Run React App

After setup:

1. Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd my-app
```

2. Start the app:
```bash
npm start
```

3. This will:
- Launch a development server
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
- Live-reload changes as you edit

🧪 Try changing something in `src/App.js` to see it auto-update.
